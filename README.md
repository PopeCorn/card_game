# card_game
**Hello random visitor**, and **thank you** for checking out my Github project "Card game"! It is very much a digital copy of a game with cards created by one
of my dear classmates, Žeromán - also featured in-game. 

## How am I supposed to play the game?
The card game is meant to be **played on one device** by **2 players**. 
Every round both players put all of their characters in action in a process like this:
1. Select a character
2. Select an action
3. If it attacks, select a target
4. Repeat with all characters


Make sure to read the in-depth **Guide.pdf** in doc/ to fully understand all the characters.

## v1
This version has been removed as it was very outdated and v2 is out.

## v2
Download from here: https://www.mediafire.com/file/geluha2qq3ygwbq/card_game_v2.exe/file

Run the .exe installer file, it will install a card_game folder. The game (main.exe) is located in the subdirectory called "src".

Windows Defender will probably tell you it is a virus because the file is .exe. Of course, it is not - you can see all source code here on GitHub and the installer installs only one folder with one .exe file for the game.
