# card_game
**Hello random visitor**, and **thank you** for checking out my Github project "Card game"! It is very much a digital copy of a game with cards created by one
of my dear classmates, Nikolas - also featured in-game. 

## How am I supposed to play the game?
Our card game is meant to be **played on one device** by **2 players**. 
Every round both players put all of their characters in action but can only execute one action per one hero. 
To know how to actually play the game, read the in-depth guide in .pdf format in doc/, where I go over all characters and their usage.

There isn't a way to download the .exe version of the game yet, still working towards that.

*Switching from Pycharm to VSCode is pretty painful, let me tell you*
