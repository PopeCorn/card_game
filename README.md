# card_game
**Hello random visitor**, and **thank you** for checking out our Github project "Card game"! It is very much a digital copy of a game with cards created by one
of our dear classmates, Nikolas - also featured in-game. 

# State of the game
*As it stands now, 27.12.2022, we are working on playable characters, overall balance of the gameplay and trying to nicely tie everything together.*

## What should you expect?
**Not very much to be honest** - this is just a project made by two beginner python programmers who are working on it in their free time, sometimes not even knowing what they are doing.
We know that most of our code could probably have been done better, but this is just a learning project that is supposed to help us dive deeper into Python and get some experience with collaborating using tools like Git, nothing special.

### PS:
*Switching from Pycharm to VSCode is pretty painful, let me tell you*
